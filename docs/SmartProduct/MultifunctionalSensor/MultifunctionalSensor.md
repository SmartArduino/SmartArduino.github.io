## 3. Q&A

Q: What should we pay attention to in the process of distribution network

- Make sure that equipment, mobile phone and router are close to each other in the process of distribution network.

- Make sure the password of the router is correct in the process of distribution network.

- Make sure that the router works in 2.4 G band and enables broadcasting, and works in non-11 n only mode.

- In the process of network distribution, please ensure that the router wireless encryption mode is wpa2-psk type, the authentication type is AES, or both are set to automatic.

- If the router opens wireless MAC address filtering in the process of distribution network, please remove the device from the router's MAC filter list; make sure that the router has firewall function. If yes, please turn off the firewall function and then try to connect the device to the router.

- If it is a dual-band router, please set different passwords for 2.4G signal and 5G signal, or turn off 5G signal. Do not turn on the dual-band function.

Q: If I have already configured it, what should I do if I want to reconfigure it?

- If the routing has been configured before, if you want to reconfigure the new router, switch on and off more than five times continuously, each time the power-on time is more than 2S, less than 10s, and then repeat the first step of distribution network.
