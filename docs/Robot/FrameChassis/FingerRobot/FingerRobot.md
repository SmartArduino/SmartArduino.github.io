![img](wps154.jpg)

![img](wps155.jpg) 

Take out the little finger tie and M2x6 self-tapping screw to put the tie into the finger, pay attention to the size of the tie, and use the small tie for the big finger.

Note that the finger outlet is facing down, and the rocker arm is facing the rocker. Screw the self-tapping into the head of the cable tie, fix the cable tie, and insert the tail of the cable tie between the rocker arm and the cable tie pressure plate

![img](wps156.jpg) 

![img](wps157.jpg) 

All other 4 fingers use big ties. Use M2x6 self-tapping screws.

![img](wps158.jpg) 

Palm side. Screw the M2x6 self-tapping into the cable tie.

![img](wps159.jpg) 

Cut off the excess cable tie and leave a length of about 1cm.

![img](wps160.jpg) 

Take out the M1.4 screw on the back of the right hand.

![img](wps161.jpg)When installing, insert screws on each side first, and don't screw it tightly, wait until all the screws are inserted, and then tighten all the screws.

![img](wps162.jpg) 

Adjust the tie, try to use the knob board or the steering gear control board to adjust the steering gear. Do not move the rocker arm directly by hand, it is easy to damage the steering gears

![img](wps163.jpg) 

Adjust the length of the cable tie. When the rocker arm is pushed forward and the two blue lines in the figure remain parallel, the big finger is slightly upwards, tighten M1.7 black fixing screw hard.

It is the same when the steering gears are pulled back and the fingers are bent. Then cut off the excess cable tie to ensure that there is 0.5CM left.

![img](wps164.jpg) 

Similarly, as shown in the figure, adjust the length of the cable tie and tighten the M1.7 black fixing screw so that the rocker arm is parallel to the hypotenuse. This is the maximum stroke of the servo. At this time, the fingers are slightly upward.

![img](wps165.jpg) 

Then pull it back. After the adjustment, cut off the excess cable tie and keep the length about 0.5cm.

![img](wps166.jpg) 

Adjust all finger servos in sequence.

![img](wps167.jpg) 

Then cut the extra cable ties short again, leaving 0.5MM.

The assembly is now complete. After completion, you can test it through the steering gear knob or the steering gear control board. The method is in the previous power supply scheme of the steering gear. Note: If the steering gear is easy to get stuck when the rocker arm is moved manually, use the steering gear tester or steering gear control board to control the steering gear rotation, otherwise it will be easy to damage the gears

### 1.9 Installation Left Hand

![img](wps168.jpg) 

Same as the right hand, respectively install the left finger servo 1.2.3 to the left arm in order, using M2*5 screws and M2 spring washers

![img](wps179.jpg) 

Take out the M1.4 screws and the back of the left hand.

![img](wps180.jpg) 

Tight them.

![img](wps181.jpg) 

Adjust the tie, try to use the knob board or the steering gear control board to adjust the steering gear. Do not move the rocker arm directly by hand, it is easy to damage the steering gears

![img](wps182.jpg) 

Similarly, as shown in the figure, adjust the length of the cable tie and tighten the M1.7 black fixing screw so that the rocker arm is parallel to the hypotenuse. This is the maximum stroke of the servo. At this time, the fingers are slightly upward.

Then pull it back. After the adjustment, cut off the excess cable tie and keep the length about 0.5cm.

![img](wps183.jpg) 

![img](wps184.jpg)
