# 1. Introduction

  This user manual is used for the installation of TS100, together with the motor connection with the development board. Specially, the installation is very similar to the other T series tank chassis, excluding the shock suspension. Therefore, the installation is very convenient. Here, we just take TS100 as an example to show the installation of TS series tank chassis.

# 2. Install the shock suspension (the total is 8pcs, including left and right 4pcs)

## 2.1 Materials when install a shock suspension:

- installed bearing wheel: 1pcs
- shock suspension bracket: 1pcs
- cup bearing: 1pcs
- M4*8 screw: 2pcs
- M4 screw nut: 1pcs
- spring: 1pcs

# 3. Installation a bearing wheel to the side plate (left and right)

The wheel can adjust the length of track.

##  3.1 Material when install a bearing wheel

- bearing wheel: 1pcs 
- 16mm gasket: 2pcs
- M4 screw: 1pcs

## 3.2 leave enough space to adjust the track when install this bearing wheel to the side plate

# 4. Install the driving wheel

## 4.1 materails

- metal panel: 1pcs
- left and right installed side plate with bearing wheel
- installed driving wheel: 2pcs
- motor: 2pcs
- track: 2pcs
- M3*12 screw: 8pcs
- M3 nut: 8pcs
- M3*10 screw: 4pcs 

## 4.2 Install the motor with m3*6 screw

# 5. Some Warm Tips

- Align the location hole when install the wheels;
- Track can be changed randomly;
- Note the screw models when install the car;
- M2 screw don't fix to tight when install the bearing wheel;
- By adjusting the location of the end of bearing wheel, can adjust the track;
- The same direction is necessary when install the shock suspension;
