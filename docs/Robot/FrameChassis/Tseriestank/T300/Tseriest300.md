# 9. Some Warm Tips

- When install the bearing wheel and the driving wheel, please note that the location holes must be aligned. 
- The track is connected one by one, so it can be connected to any length.
- Since there are many types of screws, so, please note the usage of screws. BUT since different batch production, the screw is different, e. g., M3* 6 is used to fix the motor. So, please choose the fitable screw to fix, but the screw on the pictures is just an example, similar but not same.
- When install the bearing, it may be tight, you can install it by some tools to let the bearing insert into the stainless steel connector.
- To let the driving wheels and bearing wheels move smoothly, together with the track, so please let the driving and bearing wheels are placed on **the horizontal level**. This is very important. By this way, the track can be move lastly.
