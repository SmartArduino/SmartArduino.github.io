# Installation Steps

1. Install the motor bracket. Use 4 M3*12 flat head screws and M3 nuts to lock

2. Put the coupling on the wheel and lock it with M4*12 hexagon socket screws

(1) This side sets a long coupling

(2) This side sets a short coupling

3. Screw 2 black top wires to the coupling, be careful not to tighten, so that it can be locked with the motor in the next step

4. Install the motor and lock it with two M3*6 flat head screws

5. Attach the wheels to the motor

Pay attention to screw it to the raised position of the motor

6. The other 2 wheels and motors are also installed in the same way

7. Install the second layer, lock it with 6 M3 nuts and M3*50 copper posts

8. Finally tighten with M3*6 screws

To install the control kit on the trolley, install copper pillars and screws to separate it from the plane of the trolley, otherwise the circuit board will be burnt out.

# Control part

Motor wiring: only use black and red 2 wires

Black → negative electrode

Red → positive electrode

Driver board wiring: black, red, white, yellow wire

Black → negative electrode

Red → positive electrode

White → negative electrode

Yellow → positive electrode

In layman's terms: the black wire of the first motor is connected to the black wire of the drive board, the red wire is connected to the red wire of the drive board; the black wire of the second motor is connected to the white wire of the drive board, and the red wire is connected to the yellow wire of the drive board; the black wire of the third motor is connected to the drive board black Line, the red line is connected to the red line of the drive board;The black wire of the fourth motor is connected to the white wire of the drive board, and the red wire is connected to the yellow wire of the drive board.

Note: It is strictly forbidden to connect the positive and negative poles of the power supply in reverse, otherwise it will burn the circuit board; the PS2 receiver is also strictly forbidden to connect backwards, and then press the plug after calibrating the socket. Compare the following figure:

 Handle receiver physical connection (note the direction)
