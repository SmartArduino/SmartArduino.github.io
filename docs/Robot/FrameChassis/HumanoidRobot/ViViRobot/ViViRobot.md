### g. APP debugging

A：The debugging of the entire robot can be roughly divided into two steps:

1. Coarse adjustment: This step has been completed during the above installation process. The key point is that the robot must remain powered from the step "main control board power" until the step "head installation" is completed. The purpose is to make this servo It is installed when the robot returns to the initial position set by the program, that is, the initialization state of the program setting when the robot is installed;

2. Fine-tuning: After the entire robot is installed, fine-tuning must be performed in order for the robot to successfully complete the various programmed actions. After fine-tuning, the standard for robots is:

   1) The two toes of the robot are on a line;

   2) The two heels of the robot are on a line;

   3) The bottom plate of the robot's 2 feet is on a plane;

   4) The standing position of the robot should be like a well-trained soldier, the vertical vertical, the level of the level.

B：Points to note before fine-tuning:

1. The concept of returning: It is the position that the robot should have when it maintains the horizontal and vertical stability state, and it is also the initial position;

2. How to debug a certain servo (joint): Click on the corresponding number, draw a hook to indicate the selection, and then drag the “joint position slider” to adjust the position of the servo to a larger extent. Click “Add/Subtract” in the lower left corner. The button adjusts the servo to the steering gear in a fine range. Finally, remember to click the “Back” button to save the initial state after each servo is adjusted.

3. The numbers in the figure indicate the number of the joint (steering gear).

4. fine-tuning to when the state is the best state: like a well-trained soldier, 2 toes in a straight line; 2 feet in the bottom of a horizontal plane, 2 heels in a straight line; head lifted, Chest and so on.

4.3.g

C：About the "developer mode" debugging experience:

1. After entering the debugging interface, adjust the position of the robot according to the corresponding servo number to let the robot maintain the standing posture as shown in Figure 4.3.g. For example, if the two toes of the robot are not on a horizontal line, adjust the servos (joints) 18 and 9, Make the two toes in a straight line. After adjusting, click “Back” to save the current position as the standard initial position of the robot.

2. After adjusting each joint position, you need to click the middle button to save.

3. After fine-tuning, return to the control submenu in the app and let it walk a few steps to see if it is stable. If it is unstable, continue to adjust the initial position. With our debugging experience, for example, if you are leaning backwards when walking, you can adjust the servos (joints) 15 and 6 or 17 and 8.

4. The final adjustment position is basically as shown in Figure 4.3.g, neat, upright, horizontal.

The following is the specific debugging process:

① APP的初步使用Initial use of APP

First turn on the power switch of the robot, then turn on the WiFi function of the mobile phone, search for the surrounding hotspots, and then operate according to the following illustration;
