**Note that** when installing, after the M3*12 screw passes through the base hole, put 4 washers and temporarily lock with the M3 nut. Wait until the “Step 5” is performed to fix the servo to the base and then remove the M3 nut and then M3 *12 screw through the hole of the claw arm 1 and then fixed with the M3 nut, see step 5;

## 3.4 Install the claw arm 2

Materials：claw arm2, 25T servo horn, M3*6 flat head screws, M3*8 hexagon screws.

# 4. Warm Tips

-   There is a certain correlation between step 3 and step 5. When step 3 is performed, do not install the claw arm on the base, so as not to interfere with the installation of the servo of step 5. When step 5 is performed, After the servo is fixed to the base, remove the M3 nut that was temporarily locked. After the claw arm 1 is installed, it is completely fixed with the M3 nut.
-   The principle of the claw is that the servo drives the claw arm 2 to rotate through the gear between the two claw arms to drive the claw arm 2 to rotate. Therefore, when installing the claw arm, pay attention to the rotation of the servo to avoid stuck.
