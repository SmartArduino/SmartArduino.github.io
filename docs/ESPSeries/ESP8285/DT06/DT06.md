***Give up the complex AT command, Simply configure parameters by Web page to transparently transmit data.\***

 TTL-WiFi transparent transmission firmware is developed based on the ESP-M2 wireless WiFi module, which can realize the real-time transparent transmission between serial and WiFi. After our deep research, the performance of firmware can be satisfied with industrial requirements on the stability and functionality. In this time, we have already greatly optimized the receive and transmit performance. Especially, we design the reconnection mechanisms at STA and TCP Client modes to guarantee the stable connection and transmission for the data link. 

**The usage of DT-06 is the same as HC-06.**

# Usage of Web configuration

 This module is already built-in the HTTP Server. Thus, it can configure the parameters by the browsers on pc or mobile phone or other smart devices, without of need of any other tools or Apps. In the factory settings, the module works at AP mode, and the signal is “Doit_WiFi_xxxxxx” , where, “xxxxxx” is the last 6 number of MAC address of this module. Then, one can connect this WiFi hotspot by PCs or phones , and other smart deveices (supportable Android and Ios, Windows) with no password. 

![DT-063](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-063.jpg)

After successful connection, input the default IP address: “**192.168.4.1**”.

 ![DT-064](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-064.jpg)

Information for hotspot

When open the configuration, there is three sub-pages, STATUS, MODULE, and MORE, as shown in the following. 

 ![DT-065](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-065.jpg)

**3.1 STATUS sub-configuration**

 ![DT-066](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-066.jpg)

Successful connection at STA mode

 On the STATUS page, it displays much information, e.g., MAC address, IP address at STA mode, WiFi connection status, IP address at AP mode, and the run time, where

“Wi-Fi Status”: its value can be “idle”, “connecting”, “wrong password”, “no ap found”, “connect failed”, ”connected (rssi:xxx)”.  If STA is connected successfully, it would display the signal strength (i.e., RSSI value, it is a negative). “System Running Time”: display the run time for the device.

 **3.2 MODULE configuration page**

“MODULE” page has 3 sub-menus, which can provide many configurations.

## Serial (serial configuration)

 In this page, one can set the serial baud rate, data bits, parity checking, stopbits, etc. At the same, one can set the package subextract time.

- Set serial baud rate:300/600/1200/2400/4800/9600/19200/38400/57600/74800/115200/230400/460800/921600/1843200/3686400

- Data bit: 5/6/7/8

- Parity checking: NONE/ODD/EVEN

- Stopbits: 1/1.5/2

Serial configuration page

 After setting, can use “Save ” to save the setting. If there are some errors for the parameters, it would remind you a failure. Or, it would successful.

 Especially, if the setting is successful, then the parameters are enable after reboot the WiFi module.

 In the later, the web sets are similar, this manual would be ignored.

## WiFi (WiFi configuration)

WiFi module can be set at AP, STA, and AP+STA modes.

**Note: transmit a signal, and other devices can connect it; STA: as a slaver to connect the other WiFi signal.** 

- AP setting: 

- Can open or close AP mode;

- Self-define the name and password for the AP. If password is none, then it doesn’t encrypted; or would use web encrypted to connect the WiFi signal. **Note: WiFi password needs 8~63 characters.**

- Self-define IP address, sub network mask, and gateway address for WiFi module at AP mode. 


**Note: at AP mode, the IP, sub-network mask, and gateway address must be not the same network duration from those at STA mode. For example, at AP mode, if IP is  192.168.4.1, then the IP at STA cannot be 192.168.4.X.**

 ![DT-0611](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-0611.jpg)

WiFi Configuration-AP mode

 **STA setting**

- When open the WiFi configuration page, the WiFi module would scan the WiFi hotspot listed in the table block.

- Set the SSID and Password for the wireless router.

- Whether starts DHCP, if yes, then, IP, netmask, gateway address cannot be assigned. Or, it need to be assigned.


**Note: at AP mode, the IP, sub-network mask, and gateway address must be not the same network duration from those at STA mode. For example, at AP mode, if IP is 192.168.4.1, then the IP at STA cannot be 192.168.4.X.**

## Networks configuration

In the network configuration, one can set the net work mode for this WiFi module. The optional work modes have TCP server/Clien, UDP server/Client, and UDP broadcast, where

- When TCP/UDP Client is chosen, the IP address of remote server can support the dynamical domain name. At this time, our firmware can get the IP address automatically by the domain name;

- UDP mode can support the broadcast in the local networks. The writing rule is 192.168.x.255, where “x” is the obtained IP address segment at STA mode.

# A classical configuration example

In this section, we will provide two examples to show the usage of the firmware. Take the TTL-WiFi module to connect USB-TTL module as an example. USB-TTL module is connected to the USB of PC.

Connection for USB-TTL module

## Transparent transmission example in local network

 In this example, we would like to realize the transparent transmission between WiFi serial port and PC. In the default case, STA is closed in the firmware, while the serial parameters is 9600,n, 8,1 at AP mode. Network configuration is TCP Server, and the monitor port is 9000.

**Step 1:** connect “Doit_WiFi_xxxxxx”, where “xxxxxx” is the MAC address of WiFi module, and here, the value is “83094E”.

 ![DT-0621](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-0621.jpg)

Connection to WiFi hotspot

**Step 2:** Use TCP Debug to create a TCP Client to connect the “9003” port of “192.168.4.1”. At the same time, open a serial debug tool, e.g., DoitSerialCOM to connect USB-TTL module, and set the serial parameters as 9600, n, 8,1. By this way, one can realize the transparent transmission from serial port to the WiFi.

Fig. 5.4 Example for transparent transmission

## Cloud transmission based on Doit Cloud

Based on the Doit cloud, one can realize the data remote transparent transmission between WiFi module serial port and APP.

**Step 1:** open the “tcp.doit.am” on our PC, and can get the IP and port from the Doit cloud (the usage is attached in this page for the Doit cloud). As shown in the following picture, get a temporary IP address and port, e.g., “115.29.109.104” and the port is “6524”.

  ![DT-0624](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-0624.jpg)  

Open the Doit cloud

**Step 2:** install a network debug tool in the phone, and use the TCP Client to connect “115.29.109.104”,(the port is “6524”). Moreover, the phone can connect to the internet, as shown in the following picture.

![DT-0625](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-0625.jpg)

Network debug on the phone

 **Step 3:** WiFi module connects physically to the PC by USB-TTL module, and then power.

Firstly, let phone connect the WiFi hotspot with the factory parameters, and enter into the WiFi configuration page. Set WiFi module work at STA mode, and input SSID and PASSWORD of the wireless router, and save it.  In this example, STA mode is enable, SSID Name is “Doit”, and password is “doit3305”, other parameters are the default settings. (Note that, SSID and password is for your used wireless router. Doit is the router from our company)

Then, enter into the network configuration page, choose TCP Client, and the IP and port is “115.29.109.104” and “6524”.

# Minimum system for the module

This WiFi module can work at 5.0V. Pin2 (RXD), Pin3(TXD) connect to TXD and RXD for the other MCU, Respectively. 

  ![DT-0631](https://github.com/SmartArduino/document/raw/master/docs/ESPSeries/ESP8285/DT06/DT-0631.jpg)

Minimum system

 Note:

(1)  The max current of IO of module is 12mA;

(2)  EN makes pin high level;

(3)  Module would enter into a update mode: GPIO0 is at low level (press SW1), and then let the module reset to power ;

(4)  RXD of the WiFi module is connected to TXD for other MCU, and similarly, TXD is connected to the RXD of other MCU.
